- Primitive types
```
Boolean, true or false.
Character
Floating-point numbers, limited-precision approximations of real number values.
Including single-precision and double-precision IEEE 754 floats, among others
Fixed-point numbers
Integer, integral or fixed-precision values
Reference (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one
Enumerated type, a small set of uniquely named values
Date Time, value referring to Date and Time
